HOW TO GET THE TEXTURES IN GAME:
Unless you've disabled the option in the AT config, when placing objects, it has a chance to use the default game texture or one of the texture variations supplied by any AT content pack. Otherwise, visit Robin to buy the Paint Bucket tool, which can then be used on your buildings to choose what texture you'd like for the building. For more information, see the Paint Bucket wiki page: https://github.com/Floogen/AlternativeTextures/wiki/Paint-Bucket-Tool
