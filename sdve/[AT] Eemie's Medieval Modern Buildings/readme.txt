All credit for the artwork goes to Eemie. 
♥ Thank you for putting your gorgeous work into the Stardew community! ♥

I asked and received permission to repack her assets on the 18th of May, 2022.
Eemie has stopped supporting her mods for Stardew Valley.
They have been passed onto minervamaga, who also been on a hiatus from modding.

The original (hidden) mod on Nexus can be found here:

The Content Patcher version for SDV 1.4 can be found here:

My only input into this mod was reorganising (and sometimes resizing) her artwork,
putting them into the correct folder structure and creating the .json files to work with Alternative Textures.
I hope my contribution will allow a lot of people to (re)discover Eemie's amazing art! 

Take care, Stardew Valleyans! 
Lots of love,

Amy (lydocia)
