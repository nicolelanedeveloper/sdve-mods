"1HeartEvent.RR.7": "Those spirits that you have encountered in the town are not elementals - they are something more derivative and simplistic, though still intriguing.

"4HeartEvent.SVE.11": "Most impressive, @.#$b#Perhaps in the future, I'll teach you some more spells.#$b#If your aptitude is as high as it seems, we may even explore some higher theory about the governing laws that bind our world.",
